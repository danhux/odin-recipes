    <h2>Quick And Simple Dessert</h2>
    <p>This simple dessert has many names and is most often served during the Thanksgiving and 
        Christmas holidays. People across the country refer to this delicious dessert as pink stuff, strawberry
        fluff, pineapple jello salad.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Reguardless of the name and what your family called it, we all agree it's delicious stuff
        and grandmother couldn't make it fast enough. Unfornuately it's only served during
        the holiday season as a family tradition. My wife and I make it all year long, it's great
        stuff, easy to make and only takes about a hour.
